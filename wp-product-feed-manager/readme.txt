== What customers say about us ==
>**Excellent Plugin / Solid Customer Support!**
> I'm pleased with this plugin for creating different feeds. I started with the free version that allowed me to create just a feed for Google Shopping. That worked well. Then I needed to create some additional feeds so I purchased the Pro version which I feel was reasonably priced. I did need to turn to support for assistance on different feed issues along the way and in each instance they successfully responded in one business day. Overall, the 'Product Feed Manager' plugin is reliable and so is their customer support.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I go with your plugin? =
Because it’s built for Google Merchant Center from the ground up: full Google feed types, precise attribute mapping and edit rules, robust filters, scheduled updates, and hooks for developers. It scales from small stores to very large catalogs without slowing your site.
Pro tip: Map identifiers (brand/gtin/mpn) early to reduce disapprovals and speed approvals.

= How does the Product Feed Manager plugin work? =
It reads your WooCommerce product data, maps it to Google’s attributes, and generates a compliant XML feed URL. The plugin refreshes the feed on a schedule, and Google Merchant Center fetches it automatically via Scheduled fetch.

= Any issues? Start here =
1) Update WordPress, WooCommerce, theme, and other plugins. 2) Check PHP/MySQL versions and memory limits. 3) Deactivate/reactivate; if needed reinstall (settings are preserved). 4) Review our docs; then contact support with details if needed.

= What's the best WooCommerce feed plugin? =
If you’re comparing the *best WooCommerce feed plugin*, pick one focused on Google: all key GMC feed types (Primary, Supplemental, Promotions, Local Inventory, Manufacturer Center, Dynamic Remarketing, Product Ratings), advanced attribute mapping and filters, scheduled updates, and proven large‑catalog performance.
Pro tip: Exclude low‑margin or low‑stock items with filters to improve ROAS.

= How to create a WooCommerce product feed? =
Here’s how to *create a WooCommerce product feed* in 3 steps:
1) Go to **Product Feeds → Add New** → choose **Google Product Feed**, set target country and language.
2) Map required attributes (id, title, description, link, image_link, price, availability, condition) and recommended ones (brand, gtin, mpn). Add rules/filters if needed.
3) Click **Generate** and copy the feed URL.
Pro tip: Add UTM parameters so GMC traffic is cleanly attributed in GA/GAds.

= Does it support variables, custom fields, and product identifiers? =
Yes. Variable products and variations are supported. You can map custom meta (including ACF) and send identifiers (brand/gtin/mpn) using WooCommerce’s identifier fields in the selector.

= Best Google Shopping plugin for WooCommerce? =
For Google Shopping, choose a plugin built around Google’s specs and workflows: complete Google feed types, powerful edit rules, scheduled updates, and performance for large catalogs. Free covers Google essentials; Pro adds unlimited products per feed and multilingual/multi‑channel options.

= What’s included in Free vs Pro? =
Free: All Google essentials with a **limit of 100 products per feed**.
Pro: **Unlimited** products per feed, advanced filtering, multilingual support (WPML/Polylang/TranslatePress), and more channels (Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Instagram, Etsy, Pinterest, etc.).
Pro tip: Upgrade before you exceed the free cap to keep Diagnostics consistent across SKUs.

= Auto Sync: Does it work? =
Yes! Automatic sync is our core feature. The plugin refreshes the feed URL on a schedule; in Google Merchant Center use **Products → Feeds → (+) → Scheduled fetch** to pull the latest version automatically.
Pro tip: On low‑traffic sites, set a real server cron alongside WP‑Cron for maximum reliability.

= How to connect WooCommerce to Google Merchant Center? =
1) Create and **Generate** your Google feed in the plugin → copy the feed URL.
2) In **Google Merchant Center**: **Products → Feeds → (+)**, pick country/language, choose **Scheduled fetch**, paste URL, set frequency/time, save.
3) Verify and claim your website; configure shipping (and tax where applicable).
4) After the first fetch, check **Diagnostics** and adjust mapping/rules to resolve warnings.
Pro tip: Fix identifiers, price/availability, and category mapping first—these drive the biggest approval wins.
